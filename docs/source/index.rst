CelLink uniquely enables cell subtype annotation, correction of mislabelled cells, and spatial transcriptomic analyses by imputing transcriptomic profiles for spatial proteomics data. Its great ability to impute large-scale paired single-cell multi-omics profiles positions it as a pivotal tool for building single-cell multi-modal foundation models.
